# mushroom_game_LWJGL
A mushroom gathering game. 

## TODO
- draw methods and shaders
- procedural generation of terrain
- interact methods, update (physics - only for player) and collisions
- utilities: loaders for objects, textures, shaders (if external files), sounds
Later:
- sound engine
- particles
- god rays, bloom, SSAO, nVidia PhsyX 

  (this is all a joke)
